## Design decisions
    
* User Role to User (One to One)

```text    
We decided that the same role could be assigned to many different users, while each user could only have one role. 
This creates ease of authorization of the potentially large number of users.
```

* User to Song - (Many to many)

````text
    -   We decided that the same song could be applied to many users, while each user could have many different songs. 
This helps to not have to create the same song each time for multiple uesrs and lowers the space required in server memory for songs.
